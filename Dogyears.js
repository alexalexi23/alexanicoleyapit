//TASK 1
const myAge = 15;
//I then set myAge and gave it the value equal to my age. I also used constant to this variable so the value will be the same throughtout the whole coding.

//TASK 2
let earlyYears = 2;
//I then created a variable named earlyYears and gave it the value of 2. I used "let" as this value will have to be temporary.


//TASK 3
earlyYears *=10.5;

//TASK 4
let laterYears = myAge-2;
//I subtracted 2 from myAge and named the after result using the variable "laterYears"

//TASK 5
laterYears *=4;
//I made use of this because it was said to multiply the laterYears variable which is two.

//TASK 6
console.log(earlyYears);
console.log(laterYears);

//Task 7
const myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;
// I then add earlyYears to laterYears and placed it inside the variable name myAgeInDogYears


//TASK 8
const myName = 'Alexa Yapit'.toLowerCase();
// Created a variable named myName to try and set my full name to lower case.

//Task 9
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years`);
// This is to create a statment where my name is written in lowerCase and my age in human years including my age is in the dog age.
