<center><h1> Brief Summary of Episode 1, "The Playlist" </h1>
<p> Episode 1 of "The Playlist" shows the life of the creator of Spotify, Daniel Ek. The episode begins with how Daniel was working for an ordinary company. It was clear how amazing of a programmer he was. He wanted to work for Google. Sadly, he wasn't accepted. The reason was that he dropped out of college. Daniel got frustrated because he thought people looked down on him just because he dropped out. He decided to get revenge by hacking Google's algorithm by making Tradera (the company he worked for) the top search without paying for ads. The company wasn't too happy about this. Daniel ended up walking away.

Daniel then decided to create a company and sell it to earn money. One day, while he was scrolling on his computer, he decided to test out Pirate Bay (One of the top browsers as it has free music). There were a lot of issues on Pirate Bay as it has a lot of ads, the downloading time takes a while, and it lags when you play music. Not to mention, Pirate Bay also has a lot of cases against them as they were publishing copyrighted music. It inspired Daniel to create a prototype where music was available for everyone for free but in a legal way. He decided to approach Martin Lorentzon. 

They went through multiple hardships during the development of Spotify as they had to get the consent of the artists and a radio license. After a few days, Daniel decided to do the easiest but riskiest way, going to meet Per Sudin. After the mini concert of Bobbi, Daniel's friend, he met Per Sudin. He went to talk to him about how he could change the music industry, saying that he could give people free music but legal. Per Sudin was annoyed by what Daniel said about "Free Music." That is the summary of episode 1. </p>

<center><h1> My reaction paper</h1>

<p> I was amazed that Daniel Ek is a good programmer even though he dropped out of college. I was intrigued by how persistent he was about his idea of changing the music industry by developing Spotify. It shows how confident Daniel Ek is when it comes to coding. I was also amazed at how Daniel went to such lengths just to make this work. I was also angered by the fact that Per Sudin was so rude in handling the situation about how Daniel Ek went to talk to him on how to solve the Pirate Bay issue but I understand him now. This episode showed me the personalities of the characters, especially Daniel Ek...</p>
